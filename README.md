# Hands-on-Application-Development-with-React-and-Bootstrap
Hands-on Application Development with React and Bootstrap, published by Packt

Owing to space constraints I had to take a few things out.  Originally, I had every begin and done folder "ready to go".  They contained all the images, which never change.  They took up too much space so they're in assets, but I didn't copy them to every folder.  If you want to review a working app from any project, just copy the images folder into the public folder.

I also had to take out the finished site.  You can find that on my github page at
